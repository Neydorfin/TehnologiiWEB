                    <hr >
                    <p><b>The European Union (EU)</b> is a political and economic union of 27 member
                        states that are located primarily in Europe.The union has a total
                        area of 4,233,255.3 km2 (1,634,469.0 sq mi) and an estimated total
                        population of about 447 million. An internal single market has been
                        established through a standardised system of laws that apply in all
                        member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the
                        states have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free
                        movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal
                        market; enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain
                        common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development.
                        Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area,
                        roaming charges also. A monetary union was established in 1999, coming into
                        full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 member states which use the euro
                        currency.

                    <p>
                        The union and EU citizenship were established when the Maastricht Treaty came
                        into force in 1993.[16] The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel
                        Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established,
                        respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome. The original
                        member states of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner
                        Six: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The
                        communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of 21 new member
                        states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit. The latest major
                        amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force
                        in 2009. In 2020, the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU.[17]
                        Before this, four territories of member states had left the EU or its forerunners.

                    <p>
                        During the centuries that followed the fall of Rome in 476, several European states viewed
                        themselves as translatio imperii ("transfer of rule") of the defunct Roman Empire: the Frankish
                        Empire (481–843) and the Holy Roman Empire (962–1806) were thereby attempts to resurrect Rome
                        in the West.This political philosophy of a supra-national rule over the continent, similar to
                        the example of the ancient Roman Empire, resulted in the early Middle Ages in the concept of
                        a renovatio imperii ("restoration of the empire"), either in the forms of the Reichsidee
                        ("imperial idea") or the religiously inspired Imperium Christianum ("christian empire"). Medieval
                        Christendom and the political power of the Papacy have been cited as conducive to European
                        integration and unity.

                        In the eastern parts of the continent, the Russian Tsardom, and ultimately the Empire (1547–1917),
                        declared Moscow to be Third Rome and inheritor of the Eastern tradition after the fall of Constantinople
                        in 1453. The gap between Greek East and Latin West had already been widened by the political scission
                        of the Roman Empire in the 4th century and the Great Schism of 1054,[35][36][37] and would be eventually
                        widened again by the Iron Curtain (1945–1991) before the enlargement of the European Union towards
                        Eastern Europe since 2004 onward.

                    <h4>Population</h4>
                    <p>
                        As of 1 January 2021, the population of the European Union was about 447 million people (5.8 per cent of
                        the world population). In 2015, 5.1 million children were born in the EU-28 corresponding to a
                        birth rate of 10 per 1,000, which is 8 births below the world average. For comparison, the EU-28 birth
                        rate had stood at 10.6 in 2000, 12.8 in 1985 and 16.3 in 1970.[81] Its population growth rate was positive
                        at an estimated 0.23 per cent in 2016.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Urbanisation</h4>
                    <p>
                        The EU contains about 40 urban areas with populations of over 1 million. With a population of over 13 million,
                        Paris is the largest metropolitan area and the only megacity in the EU. Paris is followed by Madrid, Barcelona,
                        Berlin, the Ruhr, Milan, and Rome, all with a metropolitan population of over 4 million.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Religion</h4>
                    <p>
                        Christians in the European Union are divided among members of Catholicism (both Roman and Eastern Rite), numerous
                        Protestant denominations (Anglicans, Lutherans, and Reformed forming the bulk of this category), and the Eastern
                        Orthodox Church. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million,[114] and an estimated Jewish
                        population of over a million. The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism are also represented
                        in the EU population.

                        Through successive enlargements, the European Union has grown from the six founding states (Belgium, France, West Germany,
                        Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to 27 members. Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding
                        treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial
                        delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often
                        referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".

                        To become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in
                        Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy;
                        and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria
                        is the responsibility of the European Council. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty provides the basis for a member to
                        leave the EU. Two territories have left the union: Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985; the
                        United Kingdom formally invoked Article 50 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union in 2017, and became the only
                        sovereign state to leave when it withdrew from the EU in 2020.

                        The European Union's member states cover an area of 4,233,262 square kilometres (1,634,472 sq mi).
                        The EU's highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps, 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft) above sea level.
                        The lowest points in the EU are Lammefjorden, Denmark, and Zuidplaspolder, Netherlands, at 7 m
                        (23 ft) below sea level. The landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline,
                        which is 65,993 kilometres (41,006 mi) long.

                        members of the union, the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic (north-east Europe) to tropical (French Guiana),
                        rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with
                        a temperate maritime climate (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a Mediterranean climate
                        (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate (Northern Balkans and Central Europe).

                        The European Union operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making,
                        and according to the principles of conferral (which says that it should act only within the limits of the
                        competences conferred on it by the treaties) and of subsidiarity (which says that it should act only where
                        an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). Laws made by the EU institutions
                        are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which
                        come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically
                        require national implementation measures (directives)

                    <p>
                        The European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its institutions: the European Parliament, the European
                        Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union,
                        the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is
                        shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by
                        the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned
                        Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank. The
                        interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
                        The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise
                        the EU or operate in a specific area.

                        Since the creation of the European Union in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home
                        affairs; initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. Accordingly, the union has legislated
                        in areas such as extradition,family law, asylum law, and criminal justice. Prohibitions against
                        sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In more recent years, these have been
                        supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual
                        orientation. By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place,
                        age discrimination, and racial discrimination.

                        The EU has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecutorial and immigrations controls across the member
                        states: Europol for co-operation of police forces,[193] Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors, and Frontex
                        for co-operation between border control authorities.[195] The EU also operates the Schengen Information System which
                        provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed
                        with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime.

                        negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the EU's common commercial policy.[196] Steps for a more

                        which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. 
                        In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed 
                        as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.

                        The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole,
                        including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.
                        The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue.
                        The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred
                        over the war in Iraq.

                        As a political entity the European Union is represented in the World Trade Organization (WTO). EU member states
                        own the estimated second largest after the United States (US$105 trillion) net wealth in the world, equal
                        to around 20 per cent (~€60 trillion) of the US$36 trillion (~€300 trillion)[232] global wealth.[233]
                        19 member states have joined a monetary union known as the eurozone, which uses the euro as a single
                        currency. The currency union represents 342 million EU citizens.[234] The euro is the second largest
                        reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar.
                        [235][236][237] Of the top 500 largest corporations in the world measured by revenue in 2010, 161 had
                        their headquarters in the EU.[238] In 2016, unemployment in the EU stood at 8.9 per cent[239] while
                        inflation was at 2.2 per cent, and the account balance at −0.9 per cent of GDP. The average annual
                        net earnings in the European Union was around €24,000 (US$30,000)[240] in 2015.

                        The European Union has long sought to mitigate the effects of free markets by protecting
                        workers rights and preventing social and environmental dumping. To this end it has adopted
                        laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards. These included the Working
                        Time Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. The EU has also sought to
                        coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals
                        exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social
                        security and health services in other member states. Social security main legislation is
                        found in the Equal Treatment in Occupational Social Security Directive 86/378, the Equal
                        Treatment in Social Security Directive 79/7/EEC, the Social Security Regulation 1408/71/EC
                        and 883/2004/EC and the Directive 2005/36/EC. The European Social Charter is the main body that
                        recognises the social rights of European citizens.
