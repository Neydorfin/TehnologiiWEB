            <hr>
            <p>The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member
                states that are located primarily in Europe.The union has a total
                area of 4,233,255.3 km2 (1,634,469.0 sq mi) and an estimated total
                population of about 447 million. An internal single market has been
                established through a standardised system of laws that apply in all
                member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the
                states have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free
                movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal
                market; enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain
                common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development.
                Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area,
                roaming charges also. A monetary union was established in 1999, coming into
                full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 member states which use the euro
                currency. The EU has often been described as a sui generis political entity
                (without precedent or comparison) with the characteristics of either a
                federation or confederation.</p>
